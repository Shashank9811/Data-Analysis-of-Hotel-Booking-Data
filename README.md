In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data, employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Data Analysis and Visualization techniques using Python. The primary objective was to gain valuable insights into the patterns and trends present in the dataset.

During the EDA phase, we explored various aspects of the data, such as booking patterns, guest demographics, booking channels, and stay durations. A crucial discovery from our analysis was the high cancellation rate within the dataset. Further investigation led to a significant observation: the cancellation rate was notably higher on days when the hotel prices were comparatively higher.

To delve deeper into this correlation, we visualized the relationship between the cancellation rate and price fluctuations over time. Our data visualizations clearly demonstrated that an increase in hotel prices directly corresponded to a surge in booking cancellations. This finding revealed a potential solution to mitigate cancellations.

Based on our analysis, we suggested two key strategies for reducing the cancellation rate:

1)Optimizing Pricing: The hotel management should consider adjusting their pricing strategy to minimize fluctuations in prices during peak demand periods. Offering competitive rates during high-demand days may encourage guests to keep their bookings.

2)Enhancing Facilities and Services: To retain customers and provide added value, the hotel should focus on improving their facilities and services. This might include offering additional amenities, enhancing guest experiences, and ensuring a pleasant stay for every guest.

By implementing these recommendations, the hotel can strive to lower the cancellation rate, leading to improved guest satisfaction and overall business performance.
